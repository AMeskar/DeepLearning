ANTARES Data Processing and Neural Network Training

Introduction

This project processes simulated ANTARES data, prepares it for machine learning, and implements various neural network models for classification tasks. It demonstrates proficiency in Python, shell scripting, machine learning, and data preprocessing, showcasing an end-to-end pipeline.

The scripts provided achieve the following:

  Extract and normalize data from files.

  Transform data into usable matrices for machine learning.
 
  Implement Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).
  
  Automate data preparation using shell scripts.
